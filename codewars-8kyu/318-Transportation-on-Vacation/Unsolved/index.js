// Transportation on Vacation

// After a hard quarter in the office you decide to get some rest on a vacation. So you will book a flight for you and your girlfriend and try to leave all the mess behind you.

// You will need a rental car in order for you to get around in your vacation. The manager of the car rental makes you some good offers.

// Every day you rent the car costs $40. If you rent the car for 7 or more days, you get $50 off your total. Alternatively, if you rent the car for 3 or more days, you get $20 off your total.

// Write a code that gives out the total amount for different days(d).

function rentalCarCost(d) {
  // your code here
}

console.log(`40 === ${rentalCarCost(1)}`);
console.log(`80 === ${rentalCarCost(2)}`);
console.log(`100 === ${rentalCarCost(3)}`);
console.log(`140 === ${rentalCarCost(4)}`);
console.log(`180 === ${rentalCarCost(5)}`);
console.log(`220 === ${rentalCarCost(6)}`);
console.log(`230 === ${rentalCarCost(7)}`);
console.log(`270 === ${rentalCarCost(8)}`);
