// In this simple assignment you are given a number and have to make it negative. But maybe the number is already negative?

// The number can be negative already, in which case no change is required.
// Zero (0) is not checked for any specific sign. Negative zeros make no mathematical sense.

function returnNegative(num){
    // write code here
}

// run 'node index.js' in your terminal to test the results
console.log(`3 returns: ${returnNegative(3)}`);

console.log(`-4 returns: ${returnNegative(-4)}`);
